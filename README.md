# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains [my solutions](https://exercism.org/profiles/AyomideA-S/solutions) to the tracks on [Exercism](https://exercism.org). I use these challenges to sharpen my proficiency in languages like Python, C, and R.

## 🚀 Progress

| Language | Progress | Key Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C | 1/84 | Functions |
| Python | 2/143 | Basics |
| R | 3/85 | Basics |
| x86-64 Assembly | 1/114 | Basic Syntax |

## 🛠 Project Structure

Each folder is organized by language and then by exercise name:
`/[language]/[exercise-name]/`

## 📝 Learning Notes

I often document "Aha!" moments from these challenges in my personal PKM system. Significant breakthroughs regarding algorithms or language-specific syntax are mirrored here in the exercise directories.
